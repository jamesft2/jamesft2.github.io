        <h1>MD Nutshell</h1>
        <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) is a simulation tool frequently used to understand both atomic and soft systems.</p>
        <p>The core concept of MD is the following algorithms
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate the forces felt by each particle on each particle</li>
            <li>Compute new positions based on the current forces and velocities (see Verlet algorithm)</li>
            <li>Adjust the velocities such that they obey the thermostat</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2>Ensembles</h2>
        <p>
            Ensembles are a way of saying what is controlled in the system.
            If your simulation is modeling a closed system, you might say you control the number of particles, volume,
            and temperature (NVT).
            If your simulation is modeling an open system, you might say you control the number of particles, pressure,
            and temperature (NPT).
            There are other elements you might also want to control which give rise to other ensembles (NPH, NVE, etc.)
        </p>
        <h3>Thermostats and Barostats</h3>
        <p>
            Nose-Hoover = MTTK ==> This is the thermostat I usually use.
            Constant Pressure ==> Brenderson Barostat
        </p>
        <h2>Units</h2>
        <p>The units of the simulation are based off the arbitrary decisions of the energy scale (set by the pair
            potential) and the mass of the particles.
            Different 'force fields' (which describe the interactions between particles), will set different energy
            scales. Sometimes, these scales correspond to real units (i.e. Martini )
            Othertimes, they are arbirtrary and can be reported in reduced units (i.e. Gaussian chain). Then, the
            effective time and length scales can be calculated by approximated with known properties (i.e. diffusion or
            chain length)
        </p>

        <h2>Particles and Interactions</h2>
        <p>
            MD simulations are particle based simulations. This means they are fundementally different than other
            continuum level simulation tools and DFT.
            Some Monte Carlo methods and MPCD Solvent methods are also particle based.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, the largest input parameter to an MD simulation is what are the particles and how do they interact
            with eachother. These interactions are highly dependent on the system being modeled (and the relevant length
            scale).
            A set of interactions is refered to as a 'force field'.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two main classes of interactions: Specific and Pair Interactions.

            Pair interactions act between all pairs of particles in the system, typically modeling van der Waals,
            electrostatics, hard core repulsion, etc.

            Specific interactions are used to model chemical or physical interactions which exist due to specific
            mechanisms not modeled at a given resolution.
            For example, chemical bonds, bond angles, and dihedral angles all represent features which are not modeled
            by these particles (but do exist for real atoms), just need to be modeled.

        <h2>Periodic Boundaries</h2>
        <p>
            The simulation box has one unique property -- it is periodic in all directions. It can have any shape, but
            it will always wrap, such that a particle that leaves the right side of the box will re-enter on the left.
            As a rule of thumb, the box should be larger than 5 times the size of the largest element of the simulation
            (i.e. 5 times the radius of gyration of a polymer, 5 times the thickness of a membrane, etc). This runs into
            issues with things like gels which do span the entire box, and the 'Finite Size' of the system should
            usually be tested.
        </p>
        <h2>MD Textbooks</h2>
        <p>Allen and Tildesley is a rich textbook on many of the fundemental algorithms and MD concepts (but is very
            dense)</p>
        <p>Frenkel and Smit is supposedly also good.</p>
