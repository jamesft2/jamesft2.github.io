        <h1>MD Nutshell</h1>
        <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) is a simulation tool frequently used to understand both atomic and soft systems.</p>
        <p>The core concept of MD is the following algorithms
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate the forces felt by each particle on each particle</li>
            <li>Compute new positions based on the current forces and velocities (see Verlet algorithm)</li>
            <li>Adjust the velocities such that they obey the thermostat</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2>Ensembles</h2>
        <p>
            Ensembles are a way of saying what is controlled in the system.
            If your simulation is modeling a closed system, you might say you control the number of particles, volume,
            and temperature (NVT).
            If your simulation is modeling an open system, you might say you control the number of particles, pressure,
            and temperature (NPT).
            There are other elements you might also want to control which give rise to other ensembles (NPH, NVE, etc.)
        </p>
        <h2>Units</h2>
        <p>The units of the simulation are based off the arbitrary decisions of the energy scale (set by the pair
            potential) and the mass of the particles.
            Different 'force fields' (which describe the interactions between particles), will set different energy
            scales. Sometimes, these scales correspond to real units (i.e. Martini )
            Othertimes, they are arbirtrary and can be reported in reduced units (i.e. Gaussian chain). Then, the
            effective time and length scales can be calculated by approximated with known properties (i.e. diffusion or
            chain length)
        </p>


        <h2>MD Textbooks</h2>
        <p>Allen and Tildesley is a rich textbook on many of the fundemental algorithms and MD concepts (but is very
            dense)</p>
        <p>Frenkel and Smit is supposedly also good.</p>
